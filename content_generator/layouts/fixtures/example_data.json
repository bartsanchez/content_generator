    "content": "Margaretha Zelle was born 7 August 1876, in Leeuwarden, Netherlands.[3] She was the eldest of four children of Adam Zelle (2 October 1840 \u2013 13 March 1910) and his first wife Antje van der Meulen (21 April 1842 \u2013 9 May 1891).[4] She had three brothers. Her father owned a hat shop, made successful investments in the oil industry, and became affluent enough to give Margaretha a lavish early childhood[5] that included exclusive schools until the age of 13.[6] Despite traditional assertions that Mata Hari was partly of Javanese, i.e. Indonesian, descent, scholars conclude she had no Asian or Middle Eastern ancestry and both her parents were Dutch.[7]\r\n\r\nSoon after Margaretha's father went bankrupt in 1889, her parents divorced, and then her mother died in 1891.[5][6] Her father remarried in Amsterdam on 9 February 1893 to Susanna Catharina ten Hoove (11 March 1844 \u2013 1 December 1913), by whom he had no children. The family fell apart, and Margaretha moved to live with her godfather, Mr. Visser, in Sneek. Subsequently, she studied to be a kindergarten teacher in Leiden, but when the headmaster began to flirt with her conspicuously, she was removed from the institution by her offended godfather.[5][6][8] A few months later, she fled to her uncle's home in The Hague.[8]",
